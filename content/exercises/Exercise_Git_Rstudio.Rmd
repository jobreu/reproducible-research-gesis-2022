```

In this set of exercises, you can continue to work on the `Git` directory you created yesterday (we'll be following the [Existing project, GitHub last](https://happygitwithr.com/existing-github-last.html) path). Alternatively (e.g., if you encounter any issues), you can also follow the [New project, GitHub first](https://happygitwithr.com/new-github-first.html) approach and start from a new *GitHub* repository. Regardless of which option you choose, Exercises 2 to 5 should work the same.

In order to do the following exercises, you should have gone through the steps described in the setup information for the workshop. Specifically, you should...

- make sure that you can use `Git` via *RStudio*
- have created and stored a PAT for authentication via `HTTPS` for *GitHub*

```{block, box.title = "Exercise 1", box.body = list(fill = "white"), box.icon = "fa-star"}
After we've made sure that everything works, create a new *RStudio*  project in the existing directory with `Git` initialized that you should have created yesterday. After that, create a *GitHub* repository and connect it to your local project.
```

```{block, opts.label = "clues", box.icon = "fa-lightbulb"}
You first need to create a local *RStudio* project and associate it with the existing directory you created yesterday (`Git` should be initialized there and, ideally, all files that you want to be tracked and connect to the remote *GitHub* repository should already be staged and committed). Next, you need to create a *GitHub* repository and connect it to your local project. If you need some help (or further information), check the [Existing project, GitHub last](https://happygitwithr.com/existing-github-last.html) section in [*Happy Git and GitHub for the useR*](https://happygitwithr.com/index.html).


If you encounter any issues that you cannot solve in the setup, you can also follow the [New project, GitHub first](https://happygitwithr.com/new-github-first.html) route and create a new (and empty) project. The following exercises will essentially work the same either way.
```

```{block, , box.title = "Solution 1", solution = TRUE, box.icon = "fa-check"}
You can create a new *RStudio* project in an existing directory via *File* -> *New Project* -> *Existing Directory*. As we will start working on the project right away, also check "Open in new session".

If you have initialized `Git` in that directory, the `Git` tab should be visible in the newly opened *RStudio* instance (ideally, all files that you want to be tracked should have been added and committed).

Next, create a new *GitHub* repository (if possible, this should be private) and connect it to the existing project/directory. The easiest way to do this is running `usethis::use_github()` in `R`/*RStudio* (but you can also [go through the steps manually](https://happygitwithr.com/existing-github-last.html#create-and-connect-a-github-repo-without-usethis)).
```

```{block, box.title = "Exercise 2", box.body = list(fill = "white"), box.icon = "fa-star"}
If everything has worked, a new instance of *RStudio* should have opened with the working directory set to the location of your project, the files included in the project folder visible in the *Files* tab, and an active `Git` tab. To make extra sure that everything worked, let's check the `Git` status of our project via the `Terminal` in *RStudio*.
```

```{block, opts.label = "clues", box.icon = "fa-lightbulb"}
You may want to check which shell the `Terminal` in *RStudio* uses via *Tools* -> *Global Options* -> *Terminal*. If you use Windows, you should choose `Git Bash` (which you should have installed with `Git` for Windows).
```

```{bash, , box.title = "Solution 2", solution = TRUE, box.icon = "fa-check", eval=FALSE}
git status
```

```{block, box.title = "Exercise 3", box.body = list(fill = "white"), box.icon = "fa-star"}
Now that the project is set up and in sync with the remote repository, we can start working on it. Modify the README file (just add, remove or edit a few words). If you have not already done so, add (stage & commit) the `R Markdown` report (and its resulting output) you generated yesterday to your repository/project. Instead of (or in addition to) editing the README, you could also edit the `.rmd` file.

After modifying the file(s), save the changes (via the *Save* icon in the *RStudio* menu or the keyboard shortcut your OS uses for saving files) and stage them in `Git`.
```

```{block, opts.label = "clues", box.icon = "fa-lightbulb"}
You can use the *RStudio* GUI for staging changes (for modified or added files). As a reminder: When you modify existing files and/or create new ones and save the changes, these should be displayed in the `Git` tab in *RStudio* and their status will be indicated as *modified* (M) or *untracked* (??).
```

```{block, , box.title = "Solution 3", solution = TRUE, box.icon = "fa-check"}
You can stage changed files in the *RStudio* GUI by checking the boxes in the *Staged* column in the `Git` tab.
```

```{block, box.title = "Exercise 4", box.body = list(fill = "white"), box.icon = "fa-star"}
After staging your changes, let's create a commit and push that to the remote repository.
```

```{block, opts.label = "clues", box.icon = "fa-lightbulb"}
You can do both (committing and pushing) via the *RStudio* GUI. Remember to write a meaningful commit message.
```

```{block, , box.title = "Solution 4", solution = TRUE, box.icon = "fa-check"}
After staging the changes, simply click on the *Commit* button in the `Git` tab in *RStudio*, write a commit message in the menu that opens up, and then click the *Push*  button in the same menu.
```

```{block, box.title = "Exercise 5", box.body = list(fill = "white"), box.icon = "fa-star"}
As a final exercise for this session, let's do the opposite of pushing and pull changes from the remote repository to your local project. Before we can do this, we first need to make some edits in the remote repository. Go to the website of your remote *GitHub* repository (while being logged in) and edit the README file in the browser (again, just add, remove, or edit a few words). Once you have edited the file (and committed the changes directly on *GitHub*), pull the changes to your local project.
```

```{block, opts.label = "clues", box.icon = "fa-lightbulb"}
You can edit the README via the small pen icon next displayed above the content of your README file on the website of your *GitHub* repository.

Remember that if you edit a file directly via the *GitHub* web interface, you also need to make a commit (and add a commit message).
```

```{block, , box.title = "Solution 5", solution = TRUE, box.icon = "fa-check"}
After making and committing the edits to the README file via the *GitHub* web interface, you can simply click the *Pull* button in the `Git` tab in *RStudio* to update your local project.
```
