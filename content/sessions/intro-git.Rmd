## Initializing folders and files

# Since we'd like to have a fully reproducible example, every time this notebook
# is started everything is created from scratch. First, a test folder for Git is
# being created.

import os
import shutil
import re
```

```{python, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
import subprocess
root_path = os.getcwd()
test_folder = os.path.join("e:", os.sep, "tmp", "git_test_folder")
test_file_git = "test_file_git"

## If this is the n+1-th run, check if we are already in folder test_folder and then go back to parent folder.    
path = os.getcwd() 
if "git_test_folder" in path:
    os.chdir("..")

## Start always from scratch: if test_folder exists, remove it. 
#if os.path.exists(test_folder):
#    subprocess.run(["rm -r", test_folder])    
    ## Using shutil.rmtree is unreliable...
    ## shutil.rmtree(test_folder)
```


```{bash engine.path="D:/Programme/msys64/usr/bin/bash.exe", echo = FALSE}
DIR="/e/tmp/git_test_folder"
if [ -d "$DIR" ]; then
  rm -fr ${DIR}
fi
```


```{python, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
if not os.path.isdir(test_folder):
    os.makedirs(test_folder)
```


```{python, echo=FALSE, message = FALSE}
#test_folder = "git_test_folder"
test_file_git = "test_file_git"
```


```{python, echo = FALSE, results = FALSE, message = FALSE}
# Second, change into git's test directory and create a new file with a total of four lines of text. 
# print(test_folder)
os.chdir(test_folder)
f = open("test.R", "w")
file_content = "l1: # Branch: main\n" \
               "l2: # Author: BW\n" \
               "l3: # Always start with a dumb comment\n" \
               "l4: x <- c(1:10)\n" \
               "l5: mean(x)\n" \
               "l6: var(x)\n" \
               "l7: sum(x)"
f.write(file_content)
f.close()
```


## The sample R file 

So, let's print the content of the test file:

```{python, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
f = open(os.path.join(test_folder, "test.R"), "r")
print(f.read())
f.close()
```

---

```{python, echo = FALSE}
# I also will create a couple of handy python functions that will make my life much easier:
def replace_text(file, old, new):
    f = open(file, "r")
    flist = f.read()
    f.close()

    import re
    rep = re.compile(old)
    flist = rep.sub(new, flist)   
    ##print flist    

    f = open(file, "w")
    f.write(flist)
    f.close()
    
def remove_line(file, line_number):
    f = open(file, "r")
    flist = list(f)
    f.close()

    f = open(file, "w")
    ## delete n-th line
    del flist[line_number - 1]    #delete regarding element
    for i in flist:
        f.write(i)
    f.close()    
    
    
def print_file(file):
    f = open(file, "r")
    print(f.read())
    f.close()
```

```{python, echo=FALSE}
os.chdir(root_path)
```

# The concept of version control 

---


## Preliminaries

- Git and other tools have been developed in the context of software development
(in the Linux community, to be more precise)

- Even though there exits graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for working with Git,
it is highly recommended that you have a basic knowledge of how to use the CLI 

- Once you mastered using Git at the command line, using a GUI is a peace of
cake 

.small[Since most of you are working on a MS Windows PC, it is also a good idea to know
the meaning of the `PATH` variable (what it is used for, how to access it and
how to modify it).]

---


## Why use a Version Control System?

- Version Control System = VCS

- For backup

- For collaborative work and syncing 

- There is always a (the) "most recent" version of a file 

- Given that there are conflicting versions of (text) files, Git is able to
clearly identify these conflicts by displaying the differences of conflicting
files (given they are in plain text)

- Keeping track of changes (aka, time travel; all changes are tracked and it is
quite easy to go back in time). .small[So, even if you invented Skynet (popcultural
reference) and mankind is about to being terminated for good, you always can go
back in time]

---


## 

- And, avoiding the horror of `final_rev2_update12_after-computer-crashed.docx`
(see http://phdcomics.com/comics.php?f=1531)

```{r, out.width = "95%", echo = F}
woRkshoptools::include_picture("./f_naming-horror.jpg")
```

---


## 

- For having the possibility to test new code/features in a "sandbox"
(aka a new "branch") .small[(following up my Skynet reference: create a parallel universe
(the branch), do your evil thing and then go back to your reality if you don't
like it, i.e., delete the parallel universe/branch)]

- While creating a history of changes, you are supposed to provide proper and
meaningful messages that describe what has changed. If you do this thoroughly,
you have a nice log file of all changes (like a lab notebook)

- Authorship attribution 

- Modern web interfaces such as GitHub also allow for social interaction
(strangers can send you [pull
requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)
to improve your code/document/...)

---


## For what type of files is a VCS useful?

- Most useful for text files (Stata do files, SPSS syntax files, R skripts
etc.). Text files can stored very efficient since only changes between version
are tracked

- Binary files (Blob = binary large object) (images, word files, Stata data
files, etc.) can be stored in a VCS but less efficient than text files since
every time the entire file is saved

---


## Terminology and concepts

- There is Git. 

- "Git" is the name of the software, and the actual command-line
tool is `git` (e.g., in Windows it is `git.exe`).

---


## 

- And, then there are GitHub, GitLab etc., which are (web-based GUI) front ends
to make working with Git easier, especially when it comes to collaborative work.

```{r, out.width = "70%", echo = F}
woRkshoptools::include_picture("./f_github-screenshot.png")
```
(Source: https://github.com/jobreu/reproducible-research-gesis-2022)

- GitHub and GitLab provide the opportunity to setup a remote Git repository. 
- So, in most cases you will need a local installation of Git. 
- In addition to being a frontend to Git, GitHub and GitLab also provide project
management features and allow to create so-called issues that can be considered
file-related todo items. You also can use milestone etc.

---


## Git: A 30,000 foot view

- Git is a version control system (VCS). As mentioned above, a VCS allows you to
track the history and attribution of your project files over time in a
repository (Narębski, 2016)

- It is, if you will, a (very, very) powerful undo function (well, kind of...)

- To be more precise, Git is a distributed VCS (DCVS) and hence a tool for
collaborartive work

- If you want to utilize Git for collaborative work, one approach of using Git
in this context assumes that there exists a central and remote repository. Most
famous is GitHub, at GESIS we use GitLab

---


## 

- Workflow in Git (given that a Git repository has already be initialized): 

```{r, out.width = "70%", echo = F}
woRkshoptools::include_picture("./git-basic.png")
```

Source: Healy, 2019; see https://plain-text.co/keep-a-record.html

---

## 

- Work locally (i.e., on your computer) on your files until a certain feature is
completed (a function is completed, a paragraph written etc).

- `Commit` your file and write a commit message, i.e., inform git that a certain
file (or more) have changed and inform your future self (or someone else) about
the nature of your changes (aka write a commit message). This has to be done
manually.

- Commit early, commit often!

- When a remote repository exists: send (`push`) your changes to the remote
repository.


---


## How I use Git 

- Git is a very powerful tool, in my own work, I utilize a rather limited set of
its capabilities

- This is what I mostly do with Git:
    - Initialize a new Git repository or clone an existing respository
    - Backup my work on a remote server
    - Track changes
    - Use branches to implement experimental features
    - Search (and undo) previous changes (most of the time using the interface
    provided bv GitHub or GitLab)
    
- "Google" (or whatever your prefered seach engine is) a lot ...

# Installing Git and setup 

---


## Download and installation

Git (for Windows) can be downloaded from: https://git-scm.com/download/win.

Here are a few questions that you will be asked during the installation:

- Default editor (use Notepad++ if you have it on your computed, vim also works)

- Adjusting your PATH environment (you might want to go with the second optionn "Use Git from the Windows command Prompt")

- Choosing HTTPS... (go with default: OpenSSL)

---


## 

In case you will be working with others, you also will need a remote repository
(be able to access a remote repository). For convenience reasons it is
recommended that you also install/set up SSH (see next slides).

For various reasons, I no longer use a standalone version of Git but use a
version of Git that can be installed via [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/).

> "MSYS2 is a collection of tools and libraries providing you with an
easy-to-use environment for building, installing and running native Windows
software."  --https://www.msys2.org/.

---


## Well, not so distributed at all...

- Even though Git is called "distributed", most of the time, there is just one
central server (e.,g., GitHub, GitLab, ...)

- A Git project is stored in a repository, which can be local or remote

- When using Git to access a remote repository (for backup or collaborative
work) on a remote server, you need to authenticate yourself to the server

- There are two ways of authentication: HTTPS or SSH

---


## 

- Despite its technical details, I always choose SSH, but Johannes, for
instance, prefers HTTPS (in part II I will introduce the HTTPS approach)

# Basic workflow

---


## Setting up a Git repository

Usually, there are two ways to set up/obtain a Git repository:

1. You create a new Git repository 
.small[(the next step might be: push it to
GitHub/GitLab and start collaborating with your colleagues or only yourself)]

2. You "clone" an existing repository from a remote Git server such as
GitHub/GitLab

---


## Creating a local Git repository 

The first step is to create a Git repository. After the repository has been
created, we need to tell `git` which files will be subject to version control.
So, the following git commands will be utilized:

- `git init`: Creates a new folder `.git`, which contains configuration files
and the repository. As of now, `git` does not know anything about our file(s),
e.g., `test.R`

- From now on, all examples will refer to a demo repository called
`git_test_folder`

---


## 

The content of the `git_test_folder` is

```{bash engine.path="D:/Programme/msys64/usr/bin/bash.exe", echo = FALSE}
cd /e/tmp/git_test_folder
ls -la
```


And, `test.R` contains the following content: 


```{python, echo = FALSE}
f = open(os.path.join(test_folder, "test.R"), "r")
print(f.read())
f.close()

```

---


## 

Now, let's initialize the Git repository using the `git init` command (please
ignore the `cd /e/tmp/git_test_folder` part).

```{bash engine.path="D:/Programme/msys64/usr/bin/bash.exe"}
cd /e/tmp/git_test_folder
git init
```

```{bash engine.path="D:/Programme/msys64/usr/bin/bash.exe", echo = FALSE}
cd /e/tmp/git_test_folder
ls -la
```


---
    

## `git status`

Let's check the status of our newly created repository using the command `git
status`. It shows the status of the current working tree (and branch). As of
now, `git` is not aware of any files yet, so it informs us about the existence
of 'Untracked files: ...'.


```{bash engine.path="D:/Programme/msys64/usr/bin/bash.exe"}
cd /e/tmp/git_test_folder
git status
```

.small[(Note: the main branch is called `main`; it used to be called "master", the new
convention, though, is "main")]

---
    

## Adding files to a git repository: `git add` and `git commit`

Now it is time for some file action by adding (a) file(s) to our repository. 

In the previous section on `git status` it was recommended that `git add` is
used to add files to the git repository:

    (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

That is what we are going to do now: To actually 'save' (check-in or track)
files in the repository, a *two-step* procedure needs to be performed.

---


## 

The first step is to call `git add`, the second step is to commit the file(s)
using `git commit`. For now, it might be hard to see the benefit of this
two-step procedure, see http://gitolite.com/uses-of-index.html for a thorough
description (I like the "staging helps you split up one large change into multiple commits" argument).

- `git add -A` : Adds (here ´-A´ means "all files") files to the *index* (or
staging area) -- note: this approach is against the principle of "focus on one
aspect of the code changes".

- To add a particular files to the index, use `git add my_special_file.do`.


```{bash engine.path="D:/Programme/msys64/usr/bin/bash.exe"}
cd /e/tmp/git_test_folder
git add -A
```

---


## 

Again, let's see what `git status` has to say...

```{bash engine.path="D:/Programme/msys64/usr/bin/bash.exe"}
cd /e/tmp/git_test_folder
git status
```

---


## 

The second step is to run the command 

`git commit -m "your text, verbs in imperative form"` (see below), e.g. 

`git commit -m "add function to compute tau^2"`. 

Since this is my first commit, I always apply the following commit
message: `git commit -m "initial commit`.


```{bash engine.path="D:/Programme/msys64/usr/bin/bash.exe"}
cd /e/tmp/git_test_folder
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

---


## 

According to the [Git developer site](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/tree/Documentation/SubmittingPatches?id=HEAD#n133) commit messages should follow the "imperative-style": 


> "Describe your changes in imperative mood, e.g. "make xyzzy do frotz" instead of
"[This patch] makes xyzzy do frotz" or "[I] changed xyzzy to do frotz", as if
you are giving orders to the codebase to change its behavior. Try to make sure
your explanation can be understood without external resources. Instead of giving
a URL to a mailing list archive, summarize the relevant points of the
discussion."

---


## 

Again, let's see what `git status` reports:


```{bash engine.path="D:/Programme/msys64/usr/bin/bash.exe"}
cd /e/tmp/git_test_folder
git status
```


So, there are no untracked files, that is, "nothing to commit, working directory
clean". 

---


## Git's commit history: `git log`

There is another useful command `git log` that informs about `git`'s history, i.e. commited files and folders:


```{bash engine.path="D:/Programme/msys64/usr/bin/bash.exe"}
cd /e/tmp/git_test_folder
git log
```

Right now, the history only contains one entry. 

.small[The very first line `commit ...` shows the SHA1 hash. The 'Secure Hash
Algorithm 1' is used to calculate this long, hexadecimal number for a file.
Files with identical content are represented by an identical SHA1 hash, files
with different content do not share an identical SHA1 hash. Using these SHA1
numbers, `git` can identify changes in a file.]

---


## Exercise

- Open your Git Bash
- Go to your Home directory via `cd ~` (or, actually, go wherever you want)
- Create a new folder (either via `mkdir` or `create-project.sh`)
- Change into the newly created directory via <span style="color: red;">`<your input here>`</span>
- Initialize your new Git project via `git init`
- Copy a few files (PDF files etc. -- does not really matter, but no sensitive
material!) in your new project folder
- What comes next? Hint: `git add` and then <span style="color: red;">`git commit <your input>`</span>
- Check the status and the history of your Git repository
- Note: We will use that repository in tomorrow's session -- so, please do not delete it!

# Moving back in time

---


## Undo changes / Going back in Git's history

- Undoing changes can be done utilizing three different approaches (`git checkout`, `git revert`, `git reset`)

- Depends on the state of your working directory (clean or uncommitted changes)

- A pragmatic approach is to utilize the search functionality of a web platform
such as GitHub or GitLab

- Here, only some basics will be introduced, further information is provided by https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/undoing-changes or https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Undoing-Things

---


### git checkout

- In order to undo (a) *uncommitted* changes or (b) going back to an earlier
commit, respectively, the command `git checkout` can be utilized

- You have multiple possibilities to undo changes. You can undo changes
regarding a particular file or you can go back to an earlier commit, which may
contain multiple changes (not a good practice, though)

- `git checkout -- myfile` will discard all changes with respect to `myfile`

---


## 

- `git checkout -- .` (or use `git restore .`) will discard all changes in your
working directory, which can include multiple files (remember the dot `.` from
my Computer Literacy slides)

- For more information see https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches/git-checkout

---


## Modify content

Let's start changing the content of test.R. For instance, remove line 3 (`#
Always start with a dumb comment`). First, let's print the original file
content again:

```{bash engine.path="D:/Programme/msys64/usr/bin/bash.exe"}
cd /e/tmp/git_test_folder
cat test.R
```


```{python}
remove_line("e:/tmp/git_test_folder/test.R", 3)
```

---


## 

Print out the new code file (remember, the comment line (3. line) has been
removed).


```{bash engine.path="D:/Programme/msys64/usr/bin/bash.exe", echo = FALSE}
cd /e/tmp/git_test_folder
cat test.R
```


Again, let's check `git status` to see what our repository is doing and what has
changed... the important part is `modified:   test.R`

```{bash engine.path="D:/Programme/msys64/usr/bin/bash.exe", echo = FALSE}
cd /e/tmp/git_test_folder
git status
```

---



## 

Run `git checkout`...

```{bash engine.path="D:/Programme/msys64/usr/bin/bash.exe"}
cd /e/tmp/git_test_folder
git checkout -- test.R
```

Voilà, our beloved comment (line 3) has been risen from the dead...

```{bash engine.path="D:/Programme/msys64/usr/bin/bash.exe", echo = FALSE}
cd /e/tmp/git_test_folder
cat test.R
```
---


## Introducing more changes to `test.R`

Okay, let's again modify test.R. Now, we do this two times. I will use M1 and
M2 to denote these two changes (I will also `add` and `commit` these changes).

```{python, echo = FALSE}
replace_text("e:/tmp/git_test_folder/test.R", "Branch:", "M1: New line added\n# Branch:")
```

```{bash engine.path="D:/Programme/msys64/usr/bin/bash.exe", echo = FALSE, results = FALSE}
cd /e/tmp/git_test_folder
git status
git add . -A
git commit -m "add new line (M1)"
```

```{python, echo = FALSE}
replace_text("e:/tmp/git_test_folder/test.R", "mean\(x\)", "M2: A new comment")
```

```{bash engine.path="D:/Programme/msys64/usr/bin/bash.exe", echo = FALSE, results = FALSE}
cd /e/tmp/git_test_folder
git status
git add . -A
git commit -m "add new comment (M2)"
```

Again, print new content of `test.R`.
```{bash engine.path="D:/Programme/msys64/usr/bin/bash.exe", echo = FALSE}
cd /e/tmp/git_test_folder
cat test.R
```

---


## 

And, let's see the history via `git log`:

```{bash engine.path="D:/Programme/msys64/usr/bin/bash.exe"}
cd /e/tmp/git_test_folder
git log
```

Now, we would like to discard any changes introduced by M2 by using `git
revert`.

---


## git revert

Put simply: `git revert` can undo a certain commit and adds a new history to the project. 

For more information see https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/undoing-changes/git-revert

```{bash engine.path="D:/Programme/msys64/usr/bin/bash.exe"}
cd /e/tmp/git_test_folder
git revert --no-edit HEAD
```

See https://nulab.com/learn/software-development/git-tutorial/git-collaboration/ for the specification of a commit relative to the most recent commit (HEAD)

---

## 

```{bash engine.path="D:/Programme/msys64/usr/bin/bash.exe"}
cd /e/tmp/git_test_folder
git log
```

---

## 

And back to M1...

```{bash engine.path="D:/Programme/msys64/usr/bin/bash.exe"}
cd /e/tmp/git_test_folder
cat test.R
```

---



## git reset

Put simply: `git reset` goes back to a certain commit and discards all later commits 

Be very careful with `git reset` and do not use it when working with others!

## What has changed at the file level? `git show` and `git diff`

In this chapter we will learn about `git show` and `git diff`, which show differences at the file level. However, for those of you who do not feel comfortable using the command line I highly recommend meld (http://meldmerge.org/).

---


## 

So far, we have only a few commits. `git log` shows all commits, the SHA1 hash and the respective commit message. 


```{bash engine.path="D:/Programme/msys64/usr/bin/bash.exe"}
cd /e/tmp/git_test_folder
git log
```

## A brief intro to the unified diff format

Using `git show` without any additional arguments shows the differences between the last commit and HEAD. The output follows the so called "unified diff format" (UDF). A good introduction of UDF ist provided by https://www.gnu.org/software/diffutils/manual/html_node/Detailed-Unified.html#Detailed-Unified. The following is mostly copy-and-paste from the aforementioned source. It is also imported to note that UDF utilizes so-called (c)hunks to describe changes. A hunk is a paragraph separated by an empty line.

## `git show` 

```{bash engine.path="D:/Programme/msys64/usr/bin/bash.exe"}
cd /e/tmp/git_test_folder
git show
```

---


## 

Frankly, I go to GitHub or GitLab and check the respective differences between files...

```{r, out.width = "90%", echo = F}

```

## Branching

- In addition to providing a powerful undo function, Git also allows to "toy
around" with different "versions" of your text or code

- Let's assume that you wrote a first draft of an R script.
Everything works as expected. From a programming perspective, though, the
script is just ugly and it is therefore quite hard to add additional
features

- What I used to do was: save my original file as `my-great-program.R` and
start working on a new version of the program using a file called
`my-great-program_new.R`

- This is not necessary with `git branch`

---


## 

Let's start with a list of files that are currently in my project folder:

```{bash engine.path="D:/Programme/msys64/usr/bin/bash.exe", echo = FALSE}
cd /e/tmp/git_test_folder
ls -la
```

```{bash engine.path="D:/Programme/msys64/usr/bin/bash.exe"}
cd /e/tmp/git_test_folder
git status
```

What branches are available? Once we have more than one branch, the asterisk `*`
shows which branch is active (or: in which branch we are in)


```{bash engine.path="D:/Programme/msys64/usr/bin/bash.exe"}
cd /e/tmp/git_test_folder
git branch
```

---


## 

Create a new branch called `testing`

```{bash engine.path="D:/Programme/msys64/usr/bin/bash.exe"}
cd /e/tmp/git_test_folder
git branch testing
```


```{bash engine.path="D:/Programme/msys64/usr/bin/bash.exe"}
cd /e/tmp/git_test_folder
git branch
```

---


## 

How do we get into the `testing` branch? Use `git checkout testing`

```{bash engine.path="D:/Programme/msys64/usr/bin/bash.exe"}
cd /e/tmp/git_test_folder
git checkout testing
git branch
```

---


## 

Create a new file `testingfile`

```{bash engine.path="D:/Programme/msys64/usr/bin/bash.exe"}
cd /e/tmp/git_test_folder
touch testingfile
echo "in testing" > testingfile
ls -la
```

---


##  

```{bash engine.path="D:/Programme/msys64/usr/bin/bash.exe"}
cd /e/tmp/git_test_folder
cat testingfile
```

```{bash engine.path="D:/Programme/msys64/usr/bin/bash.exe"}
cd /e/tmp/git_test_folder
git add testingfile
git commit -m "new branch testing"
```

---


## 

Switch back to branch `main` (and `cat testingfile` should result in an error
message, since there is no `testingfile` in branch `main`)


```{bash engine.path="D:/Programme/msys64/usr/bin/bash.exe"}
cd /e/tmp/git_test_folder
git checkout main
ls -la
```

---


## 

Now, we can use `merge` to combine `main` and `testing`

```{bash engine.path="D:/Programme/msys64/usr/bin/bash.exe"}
cd /e/tmp/git_test_folder
git merge testing
```

```{bash engine.path="D:/Programme/msys64/usr/bin/bash.exe", echo = FALSE}
cd /e/tmp/git_test_folder
ls -la
```


```{bash engine.path="D:/Programme/msys64/usr/bin/bash.exe"}
cd /e/tmp/git_test_folder
cat testingfile
```

## Working with remote repositories

- As mentioned in the introduction, Git is especially powerful when it comes to
collaborative work. 

- In order to work with others, you need some sort of
connection to these other person(s). The one I am discussing here is having a
central repository C. 

- Let us assume that you (x) have two other collaborators y
and z. Then x (that's you), as well as y and z need to synchronize with the same
repository C. There also exists another model which is based on a decentralized
approach, where you could individually sync with x-y, x-z, y-z etc.

---


## Establishing a connection to a remote repository

There are two ways to establish a connection to a remote repository:
  1. Clone a remote repository via `git clone ...`.
  2. Setting up a new remote repository via `git remote add <name> <url>`. 

---

## Cloning a remote repository

- Cloning a remote repository via GitHub/GitLab/... is quite easy

- Visit the website, on GitHub look for the green "Code" button, see also the screenshot below

- Decide wether you would like to use the HTTPS or SSH protocoll

- Copy the link and execute `git clone`

---


## 

- Here is an example using my workshop on "Meta-Analysis in Social Research", see https://github.com/berndweiss/dji-meta-analysis-2019

- Open a CLI and execute 

`git clone https://github.com/berndweiss/dji-meta-analysis-2019.git`

```{r, out.width = "90%", echo = F}
woRkshoptools::include_picture("./f_github-clone.png")
```

---
 

## Adding a remote repository via `git remote add ...`

- Using the git command `git remote add <name> <url>`. The usual name for
`<name>` is `origin`, however, feel free to choose another name. The `<url>` for
this repository looks like `git@git.gesis.org:weissbd/ps2017-xx-intro2git.git`;
another example is this one:
`git@github.com:berndweiss/ps2017-11_porto-campbell-ma-workshop.git`. The url
can be found in the respective github/gitlab repository.
  
---
  
  
##  
  
- The most convenient way in working with remove repositories is using SSH. In order to utilize SSH, the remote url has to be start with `git@git...`. 

- It is also possible to use the HTTPS protocol. In these cases the urls look like so `https://example.com/path/to/repo.git`. 

---


## Delete remote branch

`git push <remote_name> --delete <branch_name>`, e.g. `git push origin --delete my_branch`

---


## Dowloading a remote branch that is not on your computer (yet)

Just run a simple `git pull` (see https://stackoverflow.com/a/2294385). Then, on
your local repository checkout to that remote branch, e.g. `git checkput
indepday`:

    Switched to a new branch 'indepday'
    Branch 'indepday' set up to track remote branch 'indepday' from 'origin'.

After checkout to `indepday`, git automatically starts tracking the new branch. 

---


## Exercise

- Start the Git Bash and choose a location where you can store temporarily some
files

- Clone the respository of my workshop
https://github.com/berndweiss/dji-meta-analysis-2019

- Change into the newly created directory

- List the Git history via `<your input --oneline>` (the `--oneline` is very
handy) and determine the first 7 SHA1 digits
